1.  Login to you machines : User/Password 
2.  Spring Tool Suite  4 
3.  Once this done we will create a Spring boot Project :- 
4.  Create a Spring Starter Project :- 
5.  Spring Starters (Prepacked Libaries Features That Enhance the Spring (Plugins))		
	a)  Spring Web 
	b)  Spring Dev Tools 
	c)  Spring Validation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Created a new package for myself 
		com.vinsys.security.vo
7. 
public class Customer {

	@NotBlank
	@NotNull
	@Size(min = 3, max = 20, message = "Your field is to short or too long")
	private String customerName;

	@Email
	@NotNull
	@NotBlank
	private String email;

	@Min(0)
	@Max(100)
	private Long quantity;
	++ /get/set

8.  The most important part how does input validation work 
	Write a Controller : 
		in a package com.vinsys.secured.controllers 

@RestController
@RequestMapping(path = "/customer")
public class CustomerController {

	@PostMapping(consumes = "application/json")
	public String createCustomer(@Valid @RequestBody Customer customer) {
		return "Success...";

	}
}

9.  Used my Postman to validate the input Validations 

		
{

    "customerName" : "xxxxx", 
    "email"  : "nilesh.devdas@vinsys.com"

}

*** Complex Validations are yet to be done : 
1. File Upload and Sizes for file upload
2. Text Area Long texts 
3. Special Character Validation 


Authentication and Authorization : - 

Principle any system that passes username and password over the network must use 
HTTPS 

How to Secure your Application for SSL (SPring Boot) Any Service So that 
Data Transmiteed is over Secured Layer 

Encryption of the data 

Lab-2
Download the KSE 

We are going to create 2 Certificates 
	a) Signer Certificate for CA 
	b) Identity Certificate 

	changeit

Should i always update my application Patches

Sensitive data travelling over the networks 


1. Start KeyStore Explorer : 
2. Create 1 (Signer.jks) 
	Create 2 (Identity.jks) 


3. Create a signer certificate 
4. Create identity Keypair 

5. Create a CSR (Certificate Siging Request) 
6. Sign The Request by the Signer 

7.  Import reply back and Done i have  certificate duly signed 

8.  I export Signer Certificate so people will trust me and so i use the signer certificate 


Securing your Base : For Transmitting username and password over Secured Application: 


#################SSL##########################
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:identity.jks
server.ssl.key-alias=demoidentity
server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.key-store-password=root123
server.ssl.key-password=root123
#################SSL##########################

driver/ect/hosts --> which allows to create static host entries 


server.port=443



How to Create A signer Certificate 

1.  Open the Key Store 
2.  Generate a Key Pair 
3.  Chose RSA 2048
4.  Click Add Extensions 
	   Choose Use Standard Templates 
5.  Choose CA 
6.  Click the Book(Edit) Icon Besided the Name Field 
	   Add the Name of the singer 
7.  Save the Certificate and the KeyStore by passing a password 

8.  Now You will have to create  new Key Store for the identity 
9.   New -> JKS -> KeyStore 
10.  Generate a new Key Pair 
11.  This time when choosing the extensions you have to Choose SSL Server From the Use Standard Template 
12.  Dont forget to add Subject Alternative Name (This is you domain Name by which your site will run) 
13. 	e.g. *.myapp.com (* is widlcard)  same certificate can be used for multiple subdomains 
14.   once you save you id 
15.  To Generate the CSR (Certificate singing Request) 
		Right Click on the identity and generate CSR - > Request (Watch the location its generated) 
16.  To Sign this CSR Generated by the identity guy needs to be signed by the Signer 
17.  You will need to use this Signed Identity Certificate in your application for the 
		Securing SSL : 
18.  However you need to understand that the certificate : is not yet trusted unless you add it to the 
		certificate store (TrustedStore) of the respective application 
		Windows --> Windows Store 
	    Java --> Cacerts
